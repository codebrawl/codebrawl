  * The first rule of Codebrawl is: you do not talk about Codebrawl. Keep your entry secret until after the voting period, we don't want this to become a popularity contest
  * Put your solution in a _private_ Gist with your own Github account
  * Don't mention your name in your solution, that reveals your identity
  * Don't fork any example Gists
  * Explain your solution carefully in a @README@ file (don't forget to include example code)
  * Be sure to make your solution as good as possible, you can keep editing it until the voting period starts
