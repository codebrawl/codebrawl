  * The first rule of Codebrawl is: you do not talk about Codebrawl. Keep your entry secret until after the voting period, we don't want this to become a popularity contest
  * Don't use your name in your Gist, that reveals your identity
  * Don't fork any example Gists
  * Explain your solution carefully in a @README@ file (don't forget to include example code)
  * Polish your entry, you can keep editing it until the voting period starts
